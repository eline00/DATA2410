# DATA2410

## Lab assignment 1:
  ### Task 1
      - Write a function named jains that takes two throughput values (int and/or float) as arguments and
        returns a JFI.
  ### Task 2
      - Write a new function jainsall function that takes a list of throughput values (integers and/or float)
        and returns a JFI.
  ### Task 3
      - Read the throughput values from a file and then use your jainsall function to calculate a JFI.
  ### Task 4
      - Read the throughput values from a file and then use your jainsall function to calculate a JFI.

## Lab assignment 2:
The main focus of the mandatory assignment is to build and test a multi-threaded server. You will
implement:
* a server that can simultaneously handle multiple clients.
* a client that will connect to the server.
### Task 
      - implement a function named broadcast to:
          1. notify everyone when a client joins (except the client who joined).
          2. to broadcast a message from a client to everyone.
          
        Based on the serverâ€™s requirements, A client should:
          * connect to the server
          * receive broadcast message from a server
          * send a message to the server for broadcast
